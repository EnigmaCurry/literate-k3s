This Org file is not an appropriate place to store private things like passwords
or API tokens, because it may accidentally be published to the web. These things
should be stored in Secrets, controlled only by your cluster. To keep secrets
local to this config, the use of [[https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets][Sealed Secrets]] allows us to store an encrypted
copy of the secrets in our git repository. Only the cluster can decrypt sealed
secrets.
* Install bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets to the cluster
You should have already installed the command line client (See =Workstation
Tools=). Now it's time to install the cluster side portion:

#+begin_src shell :noweb yes :eval never-export :exports code
echo kubectl --kubeconfig=<<KUBE_CONFIG>> apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/<<SEALED_SECRETS_VERSION>>/controller.yaml
#+end_src
