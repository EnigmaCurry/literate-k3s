This should be the very last section in this document. It is excluded from the
HTML export. This section contains code that will run when Emacs loads this
file. When Emacs loads a file, it searches for the =Local Variables= comment at
the very bottom of the file, and loads variables defined there and runs any
=eval= code listed.

Here is the startup code block that =Local Variables= references:

#+name: k3s-org-emacs-load
#+begin_src elisp :noweb yes :eval never-export :results none
<<literate-k3s-reload-config-before-tangle>>
<<enable-export-on-save>>
<<export-html-with-useful-ids>>
#+end_src

#+INCLUDE: "./meta/auto-export.org"
#+INCLUDE: "./meta/vendor/unpackaged-org-fixes.org"

Keep this at the very bottom of the file:

# Local Variables:
# eval: (progn (org-babel-goto-named-src-block "k3s-org-emacs-load") (org-babel-execute-src-block) (outline-hide-sublevels 1))
# End:
