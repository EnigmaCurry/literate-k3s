[[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el][alphapapa/unpackaged.el]] is licensed under the [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el/blob/master/LICENSE][GNU General Public License v3.0]].
Select functions from this package have been copied verbatim into the
literate-k3s package under [[https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/literate-k3s/blob/master/meta/unpackaged.el][meta/unpackaged.el]], which fixes some bugs in Org HTML
exports. It is the unpackaged nature of this code that required copying into the
literate-k3s codebase, but these same functions can be installed from the
upstream repository instead, and thus would have this license restriction
removed.
