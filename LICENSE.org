Select functions from this package has been copied verbatim into
[[attachment:meta/unpackaged.el][meta/unpackaged.el]], in order to improve the user experience using Org mode.
These functions could be removed, and installed separately from the upstream
package into your Emacs environment, its just that they are not packaged very
well, so I instead opted to copy them here.
